### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working [The X-Effect](https://thexeffect.netlify.app/)!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about JavaScript and React. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything anyone is willing to share with me!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with focusing my skill-building to make it easier to find a job.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about CSS!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tsolbrig87@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a professional 3D artist for video games! I learned to code because I wanted to learn more about the game pipeline, but ended up loving programming too, so now I'm looking for work as a Frontend Web Developer!
